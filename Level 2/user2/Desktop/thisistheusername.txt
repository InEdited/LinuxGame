Welcome to the second level of this Game
Congrats you did it 

To pass to the next level you need to figure out both the username and the password.

--------------------
The password is the md5 checksum of a certain string , you don't need to know what that is you just need to know how to get it.

Hint : use:
	    md5sum filename

-----------------

Now to get the password you need to get the md5 checksum of this file 
(i.e. use md5sum and this text file the parameter)

The username is the name of this file(without .txt) and the password is the md5 checksum of this file.

Goodluck warrior :D
